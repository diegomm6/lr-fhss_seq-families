
```test.ipynb``` is for developing and testing methods, messy file

```base.py``` contains common functions, namely Hamming Correlation calculation and others

```*Method.py``` files implement the sequence family generator modules

```simulation.py``` defines the simulator module for per slot collisions

```simulationCR.py``` defines the simulator module for per packet collisions, considering the coding rate CR

```data.csv``` contains the simulated per slot collision rate data 

```dataCR.csv``` contains the simulated per packet collision rate data 

```plots.ipynb``` is for ploting the data obtained in simulations

```testFamilies.py``` is for testing multiple families a single network size using parallel computation

```testFamiliesCR.py``` variation the previous file for per packet collision

```testNetsize.py``` is for testing multiple values for the network size for a sinlge family, using parallel computation

```testNetsizeCR.py``` variation the previous file for per packet collision
