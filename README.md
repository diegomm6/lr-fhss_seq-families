
LR-FHSS network simulation for collision analysis. 

Use the ```main.py``` file to simulate a LR-FHSS network and obtain collision and decoding rates data. The FHS Locator can be turned on to perfomr headerless detections. Support for count-based and power-based collision analysis. Support for dynamic doppler.
